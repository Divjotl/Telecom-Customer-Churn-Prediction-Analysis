# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction App
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using a machine learning model and provide an interactive interface via a Streamlit web application. The tool enables business users to input customer information and instantly see the likelihood of churn, helping telecom companies take proactive retention actions.
# Project Overview
Churn prediction is a critical aspect of customer retention strategies in the telecom industry. This project includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Model Training and Evaluation

Deployment of a Streamlit Web App for Real-Time Prediction

# Dataset Overview
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior and churn in the telecom industry. It includes detailed information on customer demographics, service usage, and key indicators that are critical for analyzing customer retention and churn.
